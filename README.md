# Privacy: Direct-to-Consumer Telehealth Companies

This repository contains screenshots and HAR files supporting our article "['Out of control': Dozens of telehealth startups send sensitive health information to big tech companies](https://themarkup.org/TKTK)". This article was coreported with STAT and is available on its site [here](https://statnews.com/TKTKT) as well.

In the `data` folder there is a subfolder for each company we examined. Inside each folder are screenshots of relevant data being sent to tech companies, and [HAR files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) saved during the process of documenting the data collection.
