# Pixel Hunt - Direct-to-Consumer Telehealth Companies

This repository contains screenshots and HAR files supporting our article "[TKTK](https://themarkup.org/TKTK)" from the series [Pixel Hunt](https://themarkup.org/series/pixel-hunt). This article was a collaboration with STAT and is available on their site [here](https://statnews.com/TKTKT) as well.

In the `data` folder there is a subfolder for each company we examined. Inside each folder are screenshots of relevant data being sent to tech companies, and [HAR files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) saved during the process of documenting the data collection.
